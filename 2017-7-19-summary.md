## Client libraries and integrations

### Background

Braydonf and Alexander have been working on libstorj, a C library for encrypted and erasure encoded file transfer on the Storj network, for the last 8 months. This has been aimed at being cross platform and support GUI applications, such as FileZilla. Several others have started creating bindings to libstorj in other languages for mobile application development.

### Comments

kaloyan.raev was interested in hosting mobile apps being under development. Alexander thinks that having Storj libraries out on the mobile market is important. There are both iOS and Android demos being built currently, many of which are currently listed at https://github.com/storj/awesome-storj#client-libraries Braydonf mentioned that it could be worthwhile to have a formalized process for applications and libraries, and that several other projects have certified modules, and could be interesting to explore.

### Action items
- Formalize and document process for building client libraries

## Core and Bridge reliability issues

### Background

Improving the reliability of file downloads has been an ongoing project over the last many months. There has been several improvements to the Bridge and to client libraries. Including reed solomon encoding has improved the reliability of downloads and there have been several pushing to improve shard replication. Progress has been made, however there are still cases where the Bridge and network can be improved for reliability and scalability.

### Comments

Several people have concerns about Storj Bridge reliability. ssa3512 mentioned specifically issues with MongoDB connections timing out. Meije brought up several concerns about: files with missing shards, replication not being reliable, slow uploads/downloads (no farmer benchmarking), and the Bridge not being reliable. As well as there being timeouts, and the Bridge can't handle a large number of client/renters. Braydonf mentioned that he's currently working on implementing SIP6 at https://github.com/Storj/sips/blob/master/sip-0006.md that should help to solve timeout issues for uploads, and provide the base for building bandwidth improvements with benchmarking.

Braydonf asked what files are most affected by missing shards as he hasn't noticed any issues from he's usage. Meije mentioned that he can download a 50GB files without any problems, but than a 5MB file has missing shards (unrecoverable). Meije also mentioned many files and shards will have missing mirrors. Braydonf commented that mirroring should be less relevant as we move forward as there are plans to have shard recovery (using reed solomon) at the Bridge, and that he's reluctant to push on improvements there and instead work towards making progress on recovering shards and detect when they are missing. Shawn also mentioned that contract renewals are not yet activated and will expire currently in 3 months time, and that the code is ready and needs to be enabled.

### Action items
- Continue work on implementing SIP6
- Look into improving the reliability and stability of MongoDB
- Improve the ability to track files that experience "missing shard errors"
- Define how contracts will be renewed and/or enable existing renewal code
- Continue development of node-libstorj for usage in recovering shards by the Bridge

## Bridge billing issues

### Background

Billing was added to a feature to the Bridge later last year. This lead to adding storage events to the Bridge to keep track usage.

### Comments

Meije mentioned that there is incorrect being displayed on app.storj.io, displaying CC takes too long to load, there are clarity issues with pricing. Blackduck had mentioned the need for an invoicing system. Braydonf asked which repository this is relevant, and pgerbes gave a link to https://github.com/Storj/bridge-gui-vue Philip had previously mentioned that getting Bridge GUI VUE out will help to solve a number of billing issues, and dylanlott mentioned that bridge-gui-vue is currently his top priority. Meije summarized that having billing be clear and transparent for the renter (client) will avoid confusion and legal trouble.

### Action items
- Clarify pricing of parity shards and implement a solution
- Come up with a plan for generating invoices with billing
- Open related functionality and bugs to https://github.com/Storj/bridge-gui-vue
