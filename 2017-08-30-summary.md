## Shard storage in storjshare

### Comments

braydonf asked the question as to why we're using leveldb for storing shards, as he looked at the history of storj-lib releases, and didn't find any earlier commits that showed using a directory with files. kfs was a solution to fix compacting issues with leveldb. littleskunk mentioned that we had once, and mentioned storjold (likely the github org). knowledge thought it was a good idea to stop using leveldb. braydonf asked what were the issues from using directories and files, as it would solve the minimum shard size issue and read/write speed would match disk read/write as LevelDB is usually half the speed. littleskunk mentioned that there were issues because of fat32 filesystems and limits on the number of files. blackduck brought up that there could be issues with growing number of files in a directory slowing down checks for shards. braydonf responded that there should be a b tree for most filesystems, so it shouldn't be an issue. later in the meeting bookchin gave background on the switch to leveldb: contracts and shards were both stored in a directory before, and had the following issues: 1. file descriptor churn and failures when scanning contracts and reaping shards (also a prob with ldb and kfs). 2. max num of files per dir on windows/fat32. it was generally agreed that using leveldb (lmdb, mongo) to store contracts and directory and files would work well.

### Action items

- Test out using files in a directory for storing shards

## Deprecating tunneling

### Comments

braydonf said that the current idea is to deprecate tunneling and expand guides to setup port forwarding and use VPNs. alexey said that has already been done for tutorials. blackduck explained that VPNs have there own problems, most providers have limits on port count, were expensive and could add more latency. littleskunk mentioned supporting NAT-PMP as part of the preparation. knowledge also mentioned that were subsidizing some VPNs for users who can't forward ports after verification or use UPnP. alexey also mentioned that there are less issues with IPv6 and should be supported by renters. blackduck also mentioned issues with VPN providers not designed for mass data transfer as a potential issue. alexey says documentation for port forwarding is ready and VPN with PIA and port forwarding is part of the regular guide. bookchin also brought up that the tor project sends users, in the docs for setting up a relay, to https://portforward.com (it has guides for basically every router that exists).

### Action items

- Go over docs for port forwarding, possibly add new links, and look into a storjshare wiki
