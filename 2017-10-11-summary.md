## Reputation system

### Comments

- Concerns around errors given in callbacks for ALLOC messages reducing reputation
  - Rejections because the same shard is being asked to be stored
  - Rejections because 1 of 256 buckets are full
  - Many pending downloads/uploads
- `spaceAvailable: true` should be used for indication that `ALLOC` messages are not desired
- Needs to be better resource management in storjshare in general
- Duplicate shards could be handled idempotently
- Reputation should be a reflection of health of a node, if overloaded it can alleviate pressure on requests
- Could be possible to calculate kfs size without performance issues, could be lead to too many open files

## Low GB nodes

### Comments

- Concerns around issues with low GB nodes and base payouts
- Currently issues with nodes going online every second day
- Reputation system will reduce reputation when nodes go offline
- Can be possible to make minimum requirement for payout with hundreds of nodes on one server
- Farmers targeting base payouts are not contributing to the network in any good way
- Getting close to fair shard distribution
- Solution could be to remove the base payout
