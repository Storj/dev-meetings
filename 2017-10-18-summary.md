## Contract renewals

### Comments

- Questions about the status of contract renewals

  - https://github.com/Storj/sips/blob/master/sip-0009.md
- Recovering shards when they are lost will be an issue for files being stored for longer periods of time
- Each file (bucket entry) needs to have a "health" metric based on the status of each shard and when it needs to be recovered
- Need to have a way to repair a file (bucket entry) from libstorj once it's been uploaded
- Right now it's ready for developers to start building apps in preparation when many of these problems are solved

## Miscellaneous

### Comments

- Discussion around new reputation metric and how it can relate to opcodes from quasar
- Concerns around timeoutRate not being reset
- Discussion around refactoring complex
- Would rather delete complex than refactor
- Landlords in complex is currently a bottleneck
- Should be incoming PR from littleskunk with memory improvements for KFS (with 25GB shard upload 500MB down to 200-300MB)
- Discussion on the length that a contract is held without shard data
