## Invalid Shards on Farmer Nodes

### Comments

- Renters arent able to download their file, right after uploading it ( the shards are delivered but they are missing bytes / wrong size)
- There are quite a lot of invalid shards, tests on multiple farmers resulted in 15-20% corrupted shards
- Two problems occured, a failed mirror ( shard hash check failed and is still reachable afterwards ) and direct upload by a renter ( successful transfer but wrong shard hash )
- Possibility that shard hash validation on farmer side isnt working ( https://github.com/Storj/core/blob/master/lib/network/shard-server.js#L345 )

## Double Offers of identical farmer

### Comments

- While trying to upload a file and the farmer fails, it gets offered on the next try again
- Farmer gets listed twice this way ( and only twice, not more )
- Exclude Query Argument seems to be not working ( https://github.com/Storj/libstorj/blob/master/src/uploader.c#L649 )
- might be easy filtered out here ( https://github.com/Storj/bridge/blob/master/lib/server/routes/frames.js#L333 )
- New opened issue ( https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/572 )

## Alloc Distribution

### Comments

- Low Responsetime Farmer get more allocs than they should get, due to the possible message to offline farmers ( https://github.com/Storj/bridge/issues/557 )
- The Pull Request needs final touches to fix the delay in alloc requests, especially for slower farmers ( https://github.com/Storj/core/pull/761 )

## Backlisted IPs/Domains by Antivirus/Firewall

### Comments
- Many Users are getting errors when running StorjShare of their Firewall/Antivirus Software, which blocks Access to "bad" Domains/IPs 
- If Farmer denies this connection, the Farmer will get a penalty for that ( for keeping it PC/Server save )
- Possible solution would be a blacklist on bridge side to not allow this Location for uploads of shards
