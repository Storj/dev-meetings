## SIP6 discussion

### Comments

littleskunk asked if SIP6 still uses responseTime. braydonf replied with yes, however it's planned to use a reputation metric that could take into account other metrics such as offline counts however the responseTime currently keeps track of that as it's updated on timeouts. braydonf then elaborated that the responseTime currently is a metric to determine that a farmer has successfully responded to several requests *(as the rate starts out at 10000)*, and that the requests are not timing out to the farmer, and that the difference between 2000 and 100 milliseconds shouldn't make a large difference. litteskunk then expressed that even if responseTime was only at 10% of a metric it would still be an open issue, and that he can reduce response time by manipulating his farmer which would lead to increased errors for renters. blackduck added that he could reduce response time by moving his farmer closer to google. littleskunk replied that moving the farmer closer to google wouldn't be a problem, but it may not be fair. meije asked if there was anything new with SIP6. braydonf replied that most, if not all, of what's described in SIP6 has been implemented. pgerbes commented that a reputation metric is something we will actively be working on, which will depend on more than just response time. meije commented that we will have to wait to see when SIP6 is implemented and asked for an ETA on SIP6 in production. braydonf responded with there being multiple phases: 1) Deploy changes to bridge but have the selection be initially inactive 2) Deploy changes to farmers to have the new features 3) Activate selection once farmers have upgraded.
