## Storjshare issues

### Background

Storjshare is what is run on the Storj network to store data, these are sometimes called "farmers". There are two components the [storjshare-daemon](https://github.com/storj/storjshare-daemon) and [storjshare-gui](https://github.com/storj/storjshare-gui) for managing the daemons.

### Comments

jukeboxrhino mentioned issue https://github.com/Storj/storjshare-gui/issues/631 around improving understanding of config files. meije brought an issue with nodes consuming 7-8GB of RAM during peak network activity and farmers were turning off their nodes because their systems were becoming unresponsive. heunland then wondered if those people were running more nodes than what their system supports. braydonf then mentioned that a nodejs process has around 1GB available. knowledge mentioned that create stream buffers are outside the nodejs space and in the C buffer, so that's what uses the memory. he also mentioned that nodes to not limit concurrent transfers which could lead to memory spikes, and that there should be a limit on the concurrency. meije also mentioned that there is an issue when a node maximum allocated space is reached the node will crash. braydonf mentioned that concurrency on file transfers shouldn't create memory issues, since not that much data really needs to stay in memory. knowledge mentioned that file stream buffers clear after around 20 minutes. knowledge later in the meeting mentioned clarifying issues around "Offers" in storjshare gui, and changing to "Offers Sent", and meije following up with changing it to "Shard Transfers".

### Action items

- Have memory profile of storjshare to track high memory usage
- Review KFS pull request related to memory usage and performance https://github.com/Storj/kfs/pull/59
- Clarify "Offers" in storjshare gui

## Bounding Sybil attacks with identity cost

### Background

Many nodes joining the network collecting data and then suddenly disappearing is a risk to data on the network, as detailed in [SIP2](https://github.com/Storj/sips/blob/master/sip-0002.md) there needs to be some cost to new nodes joining the network to bound this attack. Currently there is a time cost for new nodes before the start to receive data, it's necessary to complete `n` number of requests to improve the default `responseTime` to receive more contracts. This can be improved to reflect other reliability and performance metrics. There also needs to be some identity cost to joining the pool of new nodes joining the network, so as to protect the ability to benchmark. [SIP6](https://github.com/Storj/sips/blob/master/sip-0006.md) also describes a way to add identity cost via using proof-of-work challenge between each bridge and farmer when joining.

### Comments

shawn brought up the fact that SIP2 is better supported with Ethereum. In response, braydonf linked to an Ethereum contract for creating a directory: https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/blob/master/TokenReg.sol braydonf brought up that alexander has been working on Ethereum contracts, one idea was to have proof-of-work as means to get STORJ, however in the process realizing that it will take Ethereum to run the method, so may create issues as a means to get STORJ without having Ethereum or STORJ in the first place. shawn clarified the use case around a minable token contract as a means to obtain small amounts, the rewards would be low enough that putting mining operations behind it wouldn't be desired. braydonf then added that having a proof-of-work challenge between farmer and the bridge can be a first step to create an identity cost, and that can be followed up by also using STORJ tokens. shawn then said the difficulty should be higher than the reward, so as to always mine at a loss, and that it would be useful for joining the network without going through an exchange, but not useful if the only goal is the tokens. braydonf also mentioned that decentralized Ethereum exchanges for ERC20 tokens would also help in this area.

### Action items

- Update SIP2 with Ethereum details and other methods of getting STORJ
