## Increased response times and timeouts

### Comments

- After the `responseTime` reset bug there was another increase in the overall timeout rates and response times
- The response times are currently looking better, however we should still monitor
- There could be work in Complex and Renters that is being performed twice, some of which the messages never appear to be sent
- Potential issue with duplicate kad ids / download requests immediately following an upload
- Lots of "job ... completed late after it timed out" logs being generated

### Action items
- Increase logging to `info` verify work is accepted by renters in complex
- Increase kad logging to verify farmer never receives messages from renter
- Look into source of job complete late logs, and identify reason for increased timeouts
