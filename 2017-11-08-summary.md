## Shard storage

### Comments

- Questions on updates around filesystem shard storage change
- Updates on two libraries in development at:
  - https://github.com/aleitner/libmapstore
  - https://github.com/aleitner/libfilestore
- Motivations for improved storjshare shard storage:
  - Low memory footprint during concurrent read operations
  - Robustness (no data corruption)
  - Minimize compaction for reads and writes
  - Accurate tracking of stored bytes and bytes transferred
  - Handle high range of shard sizes without limitations on max shard size
  - Optimize for shards of multiple of 2MiB shards
  - Target low-end systems (32-bit and slower HDDs)

## Longevity of files

### Comments

- Questions about renewing contracts
- Progress is being made to test and deploy SIP9 changes https://github.com/Storj/bridge/pull/521 necessary for shard recovery and renewals
- Renewal scripts are being tested and evaluated as well as removing shards once deleted
- Questions around enabling auditing
- The changes with SIP9 should have improvements for the reputation metric which will be a form of auditing
- The existing storj bridge monitor can be enhanced to to more challenging heartbeats instead of a simple PING message
- Concerns over the 1 hour time window with the SIP9 changes
- Concerns around the bridge monitor not being able to correctly mirror, needs to get new offers

## Miscellaneous

- High level detailed docs around storeshare
- Some of the details for the storjshare API are changing, however an outline of architecture has been started at https://github.com/braydonf/libstorjshare#architecture
- Concerns around resetting timeoutRate on contacts
- Discussion around using reputation for mirror selection metric
